When assessing the value of an airplane, you mainly look at 3 things:
TBO: how many hours remaining before you need to do a real expensive overhaul of the engine
Upgrades: does it have a specific avionics package?
TT: How many hours has the airframe been used
Most recent Annual
If it has recently completed the required annual inspection, you can say with confidence that the airplane is safe and in working order. That’s why my dad will buy an airplane without seeing it. However, if it’s out of annual, you’re in the wild west.

TBO and Upgrades can more or less be assigned a dollar value. TT on the airframe just gives you an idea of the true age of the aircraft… If the airframe was built in 1980, but it only has 500 hours on it, that’s not really a 45 year old aircraft. 

FWIW my dad almost never looks at airplanes in person before he buys them. You can do a pre-buy inspection just to make sure it’s good to go.

Useful fields that every listing should have:
Location (you need this to calculate how much it would cost to ferry the plane to wherever you are)
TT Airframe
TSMOH
TBO
Mods
Tail number (in the US we say “N Number” 
Maybe: Engine type*
Landing Gear*

Both of those will be self-evident in most cases. Like you’re not going to find a Cessna 172 with anything other than a fixed tricycle gear.

Feature Requests:
A nuanced alert would be amazing
 I’m looking for:
6 seats
Greater than 2k mile range
Fuel Burn of < 9 gph
Greater than 800lbs useful load
Glass cockpit
Brands I like: Piper, RV
Under 200k

Here is a wonderful video explaining how people think about the search for a new airplane. 

Zestimate of price, like Zillow. We could even call it the Zestimate!
Easy for the artificial intelligence gods/goddesses.
Can also estimate the operating cost and insurance (and maybe some sweet sweet insurance referral fees)
In the breakdown, we can say “Engine has 60% of TBO remaining: Expect $30k in ~800 hours”
Estimate how quickly it will sell, by looking at other similar aircraft.
Could also use a zipcode search for hangar/tie-down pricing (though buyers might know this)

Other useful info we can provide, with just the N-Number:
Airworthiness: Experimental/Standard/Utility
Registration validity
Airworthiness directives - the FAA issues requirements for maintenance based on certain aircraft. It gets nuanced, because ADs can vary by part. But there are big ones like the wing spar issue that affected a ton of cherokees… It would be more useful as a general red/green flag.
So you could list out the ADs that apply to a given make/model, just for better buyer transparency
Could put a dollar value on the likely inspection burden (i.e. this airframe will require 3 checks per year at avg $150) 
Accident history (or a badge saying it’s accident free)
How often it’s flown: a general proxy for health. Since you can’t fly with an unsafe airplane, regular flying indicates it is at least minimally maintained. (you can pull this from flight-aware)
Number of past owners… another possible proxy. If it has changed hands a lot, that may mean it’s been flipped and/or poorly maintained.

Financing options
When we tried to sell our airplane, some dude had lined up a personal loan from a company that did oddball stuff like this. 


Every aircraft has 3-4 densely populated logbooks that are inscrutable. 
Build a logbook digitizer. Seller uploads pics of entire logbooks, and AI magic confirms compliance and other stats. Could also backout some really interesting info
The problem is that someone still has to take 100+ photos of logbook pages. 

Better pics
Maybe some AI version of the Airbnb model where the pics are STUNNING.
DRONES.
Have them film one video walkaround, and then we AI it into something?
Or jesus just videos in general

Seller dashboard
I suspect a lot of brokers use barnstomers, and might want some kind of CRM/dashboard
